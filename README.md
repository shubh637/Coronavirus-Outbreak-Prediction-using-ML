# Coronavirus Outbreak Prediction Using ML

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting coronavirus outbreaks using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model analyzes various features related to COVID-19 cases to predict the likelihood of an outbreak in different regions.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects and preprocesses data related to COVID-19 cases, including infection rates, recovery rates, and other relevant metrics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Processes raw data into features suitable for machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict potential outbreaks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
